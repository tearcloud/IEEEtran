	abstract = {Deterministic record and replay systems have widely been used in software debugging, failure diagnosis, and intrusion detection. In order to detect the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), online execution needs to be recorded with acceptable runtime overhead; then, investigators can analyze the replayed execution with heavy dynamic instrumentation. While most record and replay systems rely on kernel module or OS virtualization, those running at user space are favoured for being lighter weight and more portable without any of the changes needed for OS/Kernel virtualization. On the other hand, higher level provenance data at a higher level provides dynamic analysis with system causalities and hugely increases its efficiency. Considering both benefits, we propose a provenance-aware user space record and replay system, called RecProv. RecProv is designed to provide high provenance fidelity; specifically, with versioning files from the recorded trace logs and integrity protection to provenance data through real-time trace isolation. The collected provenance provides the high-level system dependency that helps pinpoint suspicious activities where further analysis can be applied. We show that RecProv is able to output accurate provenance in both visualized graph and W3C standardized PROV-JSON formats.},

	doi = {10.1109/PST.2012.6297930},
	abstract = {Existence of data provenance information in a system raises at least two security-related issues. One is how provenance data can be used to enhance security in the system and the other is how to protect provenance data which might be more sensitive than the data itself. Recent data provenance-related access control literature mainly focuses on the latter issue of protecting provenance data. In this paper, we propose a novel provenance-based access control model that addresses the former objective. Using provenance data for access control to the underlying data facilitates additional capabilities beyond those available in traditional access control models. We utilize a notion of dependency as the key foundation for access control policy specification. Dependency-based policy provides simplicity and effectiveness in policy specification and access control administration. We show our model can support dynamic separation of duty, workflow control, origin-based control, and object versioning. The proposed model identifies essential components and concepts and provides a foundational base model for provenance-based access control. We further discuss possible extensions of the proposed base model for enhanced access controls.},

Sensor data presents new challenges in these areas. Such data is location-specific but also distributed; it is collected in a particular physical location and may be most useful there, but it has additional value when combined with other sensor data collections in a larger distributed system. Thus, arranging location-sensitive peer-to-peer storage is one challenge. Sensor data sets do not have obvious names, so naming them in a globally useful fashion is another challenge. The last challenge arises from the need to index these sensor data sets to make them searchable. The key to sensor data identity is provenance, the full history or lineage of the data. We show how provenance addresses the naming and indexing issues and then present a research agenda for constructing distributed, indexed repositories of sensor data.},

However, existing provenance collection mechanisms fail to achieve sufficient breadth or fidelity to provide a holistic view of a system's operation over time. We present Hi-Fi, a kernel-level provenance system which leverages the Linux Security Modules framework to collect high-fidelity whole-system provenance. We demonstrate that Hi-Fi is able to record a variety of malicious behavior within a compromised system. In addition, our benchmarks show the collection overhead from Hi-Fi to be less than 1\% for most system calls and 3\% in a representative workload, while simultaneously generating a system measurement that fully reflects system evolution. In this way, we show that we can collect broad, high-fidelity provenance data which is capable of supporting detailed forensic analysis.},

In this paper we propose a universal data provenance framework, using dynamic instrumentation, which gathers data provenance information for real-world applications without any code modifications. Our framework simplifies the task of finding the right points to instrument, which can be cumbersome in large and complex systems. We have built a proof-of-concept implementation of the framework on top of DTrace. Moreover, we evaluated its functionality by using it for three different scenarios: file-system operations, database transactions and web browser HTTP requests. Based on our experiences we believe that it is possible to provide data provenance, transparently, to any layer of the software stack.},

Story Book resides in user space, and treats provenance events as a generic event log, leading to a simple, flexible and easily optimized system. We demonstrate the flexibility of our design by adding provenance to a number of different systems, including a file system, database and a number of file types, and by implementing two separate storage backends. Although Story Book is nearly 2.5 times slower than ext3 under worst case workloads, this is mostly due to FUSE message passing overhead. Our experiments show that coupling our simple design with existing storage optimizations provides higher throughput than existing systems.},

	abstract = {Gathering data provenance at the operating system level is useful for capturing system-wide activity. However, many modern programs are complex and can perform numerous tasks concurrently. Capturing their provenance at this level, where processes are treated as single entities, may lead to the loss of useful intra-process detail. This can, in turn, produce false dependencies in the provenance graph. Using the LLVM compiler framework and SPADE provenance infrastructure, we investigate adding provenance instrumentation to allow intraprocess provenance to be captured automatically. This results in a more accurate representation of the provenance relationships and eliminates some false dependencies. Since the capture of fine-grained provenance incurs increased overhead for storage and querying, we minimize the records retained by allowing users to declare aspects of interest and then automatically infer which provenance records are unnecessary and can be discarded.},

Today's cloud stores, however, are missing an important ingredient: provenance. Provenance is metadata that describes the history of an object. We make the case that provenance is crucial for data stored on the cloud and identify the properties of provenance that enable its utility. We then examine current cloud offerings and design and implement three protocols for maintaining data/provenance in current cloud stores. The protocols represent different points in the design space and satisfy different subsets of the provenance properties. Our evaluation indicates that the overheads of all three protocols are comparable to each other and reasonable in absolute terms. Thus, one can select a protocol based upon the properties it provides without sacrificing performance. While it is feasible to provide provenance as a layer on top of today's cloud offerings, we conclude by presenting the case for incorporating provenance as a core cloud feature, discussing the issues in doing so.},

The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

	abstract = {As organizations become increasingly reliant on cloud computing for servicing their data storage requirements, the need to govern access control at finer granularities becomes particularly important. This challenge is increased by the lack of policy supporting data migration across geographic boundaries and through organizations with divergent regulatory policies. In this paper, we present an architecture for secure and distributed management of provenance, enabling its use in security-critical applications. Provenance, a metadata history detailing the derivation of an object, contains information that allows for expressive, policy-independent access control decisions. We consider how to manage and validate the metadata of a provenance-aware cloud system, and introduce protocols that allow for secure transfer of provenance metadata between end hosts and cloud authorities. Using these protocols, we develop a provenance-based access control mechanism for Cumulus cloud storage, capable of processing thousands of operations per second on a single deployment. Through the introduction of replicated components, we achieve overhead costs of just 14\%, demonstrating that provenance-based access control is a practical and scalable solution for the cloud.},

In this paper we describe an approach to computing provenance when the data of interest has been created by a database query. We adopt a syntactic approach and present results for a general data model that applies to relational databases as well as to hierarchical data such as XML. A novel aspect of our work is a distinction between “why” provenance (refers to the source data that had some influence on the existence of the data) and “where” provenance (refers to the location(s) in the source databases from which the data was extracted).

	abstract = {In many data-driven applications, analysis needs to be performed on scientific information obtained from several sources and generated by computations on distributed resources. Systematic analysis of this scientific information unleashes a growing need for automated data-driven applications that also can keep track of the provenance of the data and processes with little user interaction and overhead. Such data analysis can be facilitated by the recent advancements in scientific workflow systems. A major profit when using scientific workflow systems is the ability to make provenance collection a part of the workflow. Specifically, provenance should include not only the standard data lineage information but also information about the context in which the workflow was used, execution that processed the data, and the evolution of the workflow design. In this paper we describe a complete framework for data and process provenance in the Kepler Scientific Workflow System. We outline the requirements and issues related to data and workflow provenance in a multi-disciplinary workflow system and introduce how generic provenance capture can be facilitated in Kepler’s actor-oriented workflow environment. We also describe the usage of the stored provenance information for efficient rerun of scientific workflows.},

To address this problem, we propose a systematic method for assessing the trustworthiness of data items. Our approach uses the data provenance as well as their values in computing trust scores, that is, quantitative measures of trustworthiness. To obtain trust scores, we propose a cyclic framework which well reflects the inter-dependency property: the trust score of the data affects the trust score of the network nodes that created and manipulated the data, and vice-versa. The trust scores of data items are computed from their value similarity and provenance similarity. The value similarity comes from the principle that "the more similar values for the same event, the higher the trust scores". The provenance similarity is based on the principle that "the more different data provenances with similar values, the higher the trust scores". Experimental results show that our approach provides a practical solution for trustworthiness assessment in sensor networks.},
